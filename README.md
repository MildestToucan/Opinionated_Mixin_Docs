Opinionated Mixin Docs
====

This is a personal effort to document Mixin features from the perspective of Minecraft modding by going over 
Mixins and MixinExtras' features from a modder's perspective, along with different situations.  
The reason for this is that Mixins have a certain lack of documentation that is oriented directly at how it is used in 
the context of Minecraft modding. Certain sources like the Fabric wiki are lacking in certain areas of information,  
whilst others like Mixin's official GitHub wiki is a lot more focused on documenting Mixins as a tool rather than their 
usage in Minecraft mods.  
This, combined with the lack of any easy to find video tutorials that cover Mixins well, makes the tool disproportionately 
intimidating to newcomers, and it is what this repository aims to prevent.  


### Navigating this Repo  
This repository is composed of a Fabric mod project for 1.21.1 that is used to show examples of the different Mixin features.  
It is not directly the "wiki" part of this documentation, and is moreso just an example built into a direct mod project that 
can be cloned or forked by anyone who wants to take a more hands-on look at the structure and tinker around.  

The Wiki tab of this repository is where the actual knowledge base will be built (WIP, to put it lightly), and it's 
where the different features and ideas covered by this repo are organized. The wiki will use the 
example mod repository as direct examples of the features it mentions. As such expect the repository to grow as the Wiki develops.  

### Basis/Sources for information  
This repository and its wiki aim to get accurate information by never relying on the author's experience alone, and actually 
testing out each feature manually. On top of this, some topics and features' pages will be based directly on more experienced 
mod devs' statements. Along with this, when possible, statements directly from Mixin maintainers and contributors will be used.  

### Features covered  
This documentation is not a documentation of the *tool*, but of its relevance in modding. As such, it will prioritize covering 
features commonly implemented in mod projects, and will not prioritize certain features that may be either only relevant 
to technical discussions of Mixin, or features that are never realistically used by mod developers.  
This is not because it is worthless to learn about Mixin's technical aspects, but because a beginner mod developer likely 
isn't interested in understanding how Mixins work under the hood and very rare features before having seen the more common 
features and their mod dev applications in practice first.  
For the content of MixinExtras specifically, there will likely be a lot of referencing MixinExtras' wiki, as it serves as 
decent documentation of its individual features for  general uses.  

### Limitations and issues  
The author of this repository isn't a creator, maintainer or contributor of Mixin tools. This inherently comes with certain 
limits of knowledge for certain technical aspects of Mixins, and with a decent chance of at times making inaccurate statements.  
If you're looking for "how Mixins actually work", look for Mixin's official wiki on GitHub.  
If you see inaccurate information, make an issue linking to the inaccurate page and elaborate on what is wrong with the 
statement or page in general. Any details and sources that could be used to improve the page will then be used to improve the wiki.  
You may also contribute to the Wiki or repository if you see it fit to more directly improve the repository.
